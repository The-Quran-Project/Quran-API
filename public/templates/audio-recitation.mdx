## Audio of a Verse

### Request format

Make a **GET** request to `/audio/<surahNo>/<ayahNo>.json`

#### Example

Endpoint: [`/audio/2/1.json`](/api/audio/2/1.json)<br />

Raw Url: https://quranapi.pages.dev/api/audio/2/1.json

### Response

```json copy
AUDIO_2_VERSE_RESPONSE
```

> The previous url: `quranaudio.pages.dev/<reciterNo>/<surahNo>_<ayahNo>.mp3` is still available. But there are only **3** reciters in that. It is because of the `25k` total file limit from cloudflare pages.

<br />
Use the links to get the audio file. Example:

[`https://the-quran-project.github.io/Quran-Audio/Data/2/1_2.mp3`](https://the-quran-project.github.io/Quran-Audio/Data/2/1_2.mp3)

<audio
  src="https://the-quran-project.github.io/Quran-Audio/Data/2/1_2.mp3"
  controls
/>

<br />
<br />

## Audio of a Chapter

As the audio recitation of a chapter is larger in size, I couldn't use _CloudFlare Pages_ for this. (As the maximum file size is **25MiB**)<br />Instead, the files are stored in **Github**. But there is also the original url from where the recitation was taken.

It's best to use the original URL if possible. However, if you can't access it, you can use the `url` property instead.
